## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

This challenge I struggled with setting the background svgs to be in the correct place on all screen sizes. I ended up looking to someone elses solution for better understanding on how to resolve this issue. By review another solution I came to realize that I was using vw and vh on the wrong position causing it to not respond correctly. Going forward I would like to gain more confidence in using vh and vw units to create more responsive design.
